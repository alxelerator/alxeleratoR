# alxeleratoR

Public R package to assist data analysis, mostly focused on using phyloseq or similar objects.  
This package evolved from my need to automate common analyses and visualizations. Most functions are wrappers around existing functions or packages, some are original creations, and others are "borrowed" and adapted to my needs (with credit given as accurately as possible). If you think Iâ€™ve forgotten to credit you, please drop me a message.  

The primary context is microbiome, resistome, metagenomics, and eDNA research.
