Description: 
    R package to accelerate data analysis, so you can focus on interpretation during data exploration instead of finding out how to code your question.
    This "package"/bundle evolved from my need to automate and share common analyses and visualizations. Most functions focus on using phyloseq or similar objects, and mostl are wrappers around, or drop-in replacements of, existing functions or packages, some are original creations, and others are "borrowed" and adapted to my needs (with credit given as accurately as possible. If you think Iâ€™ve forgotten to credit you, please drop me a message).
    The primary context is microbiome, resistome, metagenomics, and eDNA research. But feel free to use them in different contexts.
