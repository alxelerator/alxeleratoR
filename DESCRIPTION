Description: R package to accelerate data analysis, so you can focus on interpretation during data exploration instead of finding out how to code the answers to your questions. This "package"/bundle evolved from my own need to automate and share common analyses and visualizations. Most functions require phyloseq or similar data structures.
    Many functions are wrappers around, or drop-in replacements of, existing functions or packages. Some functions are original creations while others are "borrowed" and adapted to my personal needs (I tried giving credits as appropriate as possible. If you think Iâ€™ve forgotten to credit you, please drop me a message).
    The primary context of my work is microbiome, resistome, metagenomics, and eDNA research. But feel free to use them in different contexts. Make sure to read the disclaimer and double check functions are fit for its purpose. Outcomes could be erroneous!
